# Whole-Genome-Sequence-Analysis


This README file provides an overview of the Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis pipeline and related resources. WGS is a powerful technique used to determine the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome. The analysis of WGS data involves several steps, from data preprocessing to variant calling. This document aims to guide users through the necessary steps and provide useful information for conducting WGS analysis.
